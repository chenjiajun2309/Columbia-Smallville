Pick the best AREA inside the target sector for the current task in a Columbia campus setting.

${agent} is heading to <${target_sector}>, which contains: ${target_arenas}.
${daily_plan}

Question:
${agent} is ${complete_plan}. To accomplish ${decomposed_plan}, which area inside <${target_sector}> should ${agent} choose?

Campus considerations:
- Prefer appropriate campus spaces: e.g., study tasks → Butler Library (Reading Room), CS work → Mudd/CS Lab, governance → Low Library offices, dining → Ferris/Lerner.
- Respect norms: quiet zones (Butler Reading Rooms), lab access (keycard), room capacity, open hours.
- If the **current area** is in the list and fits the task, prefer staying to reduce travel.

Requirements:
1) Choose exactly ONE from this list: [${target_arenas}].
2) Do NOT pick outside the list.
3) Output ONLY the chosen area (no explanations).
